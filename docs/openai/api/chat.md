# Chat

Given a chat conversation, the model will return a chat completion response.

## Create chat completion (`Beta`)

    POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

Creates a completion for the chat message

### Request body

---

    model string Required

ID of the model to use. Currently, only `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301` are supported.

---

    messages array Required

The messages to generate chat completions for, in the [chat format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction).

---

    temperature number Optional Defaults to 1

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

---

    top_p number Optional Defaults to 1

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with `top_p` probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

---

    n integer Optional Defaults to 1

How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message.

---

    stream boolean Optional Defaults to false

If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message.

--- 

    stop string or array Optional Defaults to null

Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

---

    max_tokens integer Optional Defaults to inf

The maximum number of tokens allowed for the generated answer. By default, the number of tokens the model can return will be (4096 - prompt tokens).

---

    presence_penalty number Optional Defaults to 0

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/parameter-details)

---

    frequency_penalty number Optional Defaults to 0

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

[See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/parameter-details)

---

    logit_bias map Optional Defaults to null

Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

---

    user string Optional

A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).

## Example

Example request:

```py
import os
